P-2.5 Write a C++ program that has a Polygon interface that has abstract functions, area(), and perimeter(). Implement classes for Triangle, Quadrilateral, Pentagon, Hexagon, and Octagon, which implement this interface, with the obvious meanings for the area() and perimeter() functions. Also implement classes, IsoscelesTriangle, EquilateralTriangle, Rectangle, and Square, which have the appropriate inheritance relationships. Finally, write a simple user interface that allows users to create polygons of the various types, input their geometric dimensions, and then output their area and perimeter. For extra effort, allow users to input polygons by specifying their vertex coordinates and be able to test if two such polygons are similar.
P-2.6 Write a C++ program that inputs a document and then outputs a bar-chart plot of the frequencies of each alphabet character that appears in that document.
P-2.7 Write a C++ program that inputs a list of words separated by whitespace, and outputs how many times each word appears in the list. You need not worry about efficiency at this point, however, as this topic is something that will be addressed later in this book.
